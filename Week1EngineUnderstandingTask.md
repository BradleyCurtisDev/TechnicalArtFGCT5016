## The Evolution of Anti-Aliasing in Games

Anti-aliasing, or AA, has been around for a long time as a way to deal with a common problem in computer graphics. When you draw diagonal or curved lines on a grid of square pixels, you end up with jagged edges. These jaggies are distracting, so AA tries to smooth them out by blending extra colours along the edges. This tricks the eye into seeing a cleaner line. Over time, AA methods have changed a lot because developers always had to balance nice visuals with the limits of the hardware.

The first major AA method was Supersampling Anti-Aliasing, or SSAA. It came from the Architecture Machine Group at MIT in 1972. SSAA works by rendering the scene at a much higher resolution and then shrinking it down. This averages multiple samples into one pixel, giving a very clean image. SSAA still looks great even today. The problem is that SSAA is extremely demanding. Rendering far more pixels than needed puts a heavy load on the hardware. Early consoles simply could not handle it because they did not have enough memory or processing power. It was not until the mid 1990s that hardware like Sega’s Model 2 arcade board started supporting more advanced filtering and basic forms of anti-aliasing. Because SSAA was too slow for most systems, developers started looking for cheaper alternatives. One of the biggest ones was MSAA, or Multi-Sample Anti-Aliasing. It became very common in the 2000s because it focused only on smoothing the edges of 3D models. This made it much faster than SSAA while still improving the look of a game. The downside was that MSAA struggled with new graphics techniques like heavy shaders and transparent objects. As graphics became more complex, MSAA became less useful.

This led to post processing AA methods. FXAA, or Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing, was one of the most popular. Instead of looking at the geometry of the scene, FXAA works on the final image. It finds sharp edges and softens them. It is extremely fast and good for performance, but it often makes the image look blurry.

SMAA, or Subpixel Morphological Anti-Aliasing, built on the ideas of FXAA and improved edge detection. It created cleaner edges while avoiding some of the blur, so it became a good middle option.

As game engines shifted toward deferred rendering, MSAA became even harder to use properly, which helped push Temporal Anti-Aliasing, or TAA, into regular use. TAA works by using information from previous frames and combining it with the current frame. This helps reduce shimmering and flickering when the camera moves. TAA handles both geometric and shader based aliasing, so it achieves some of the benefits of SSAA without the high cost. TAA does have its own problems, such as softness or ghosting, especially at lower resolutions. Even so, the balance of quality and performance made it the default AA method in many modern engines. Unreal Engine and Rockstar’s RAGE engine use it heavily.

More recently, AA has started blending with machine learning based upscaling. Instead of only smoothing edges, these methods rebuild a higher resolution image from a lower resolution one. This boosts both performance and clarity.

NVIDIA’s DLSS, or Deep Learning Super Sampling, is the most well known example. It uses neural networks trained on high quality images to reconstruct frames. In some cases it can look sharper than native resolution. DLAA is similar but focuses purely on anti-aliasing without upscaling.

AMD’s FSR, or FidelityFX Super Resolution, is popular because it works on many different GPUs. Intel’s XeSS follows the same idea and uses AI acceleration when possible.

Looking back, techniques like SSAA produced amazing clarity but were limited by hardware. The move from MSAA to TAA shows how priorities shifted as games became more complex. Now, machine learning methods like DLSS, FSR, and XeSS represent the next major step, offering high quality visuals with strong performance. Even with high resolution displays making jaggies less noticeable, anti-aliasing is still important. It helps create clean, stable images that look polished and modern. The tools may change, but the goal stays the same. Smooth and believable visuals that work well on the hardware we have.
